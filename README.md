# titanic_probabilities.py
A brief look at the data set from the tragic failure of the Titanic, in an interactive format.

Using the dataset from the Titanic (every new data scientist looks/play with this data at least once) to consider relationships, dependencies, correlations and points of interest between parameters in the set.

In the broadest of bad taste this could be considered a 'game' - but the intent here is not to make light of this tragic event, but instead show insights from the data, encourage critical thinking, and promote interest in the discipline of data science. The target audience is teenage/high school age.
